# Pe-projects

This project represents all the work I have started, completed, and continue to work on with [Perpetual Education](https://perpetual.education/). All subject matter revolves around coding but also takes into account design, user experience, and what it takes to go further. Perpetual Education is mentorship program I took part in to develop my skills and create a career opportunity that would utilize the best parts of *me*.

This repository began with simple HTML and CSS. Since then it has evolved into PHP and soon will be utilizing Javascript.
