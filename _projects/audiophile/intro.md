# Using JSON data to complete a ecommerce site

We at alpha-4 gather together to create indiviual data for techonogical items. We created this data in JSON and are using PHP to loop through the data to create a responsive layout in HTML.

## For Me

* Planning to get the data
* Loop through the data and create articles that contain information of each product.
* Ideally a layout that is vertical ( a mobile first priority) and transitions to a horizontal display as the screensize expands.
* Use a button within a form to create an "Add to cart" message when clicking the add to cart button.
* Style specific parameters. Such as stock availability and sales.
* Make sure to display all images.


### Feedback?

Following my demo build it would be great to go over eachothers work and see what we like about eachothers demos. Positives and negatives.
