                        The past week has been spent practice and honing some of my current skills based on the lessons. I'm looking forward to learning and putting to use some new PHP skills!

                        I want to be able to say I have a personal website page fully fleshed out and ready to be shown to any individuals out in the wild. I want to make an effort to create more discussions within the group with an active back and forth, easier to recieve feedback in these moments.

                        <p>
                        I want to get an entry level job as a software engineer and or designer. I would love to make above 100k and be able to say I'm happy in my place of employment. The size of the company is still in question. I see benefits in all scenarios but I belive somewhere to get my feet wet and build a foundation may be best for the long run of my career. I'm open to all possibilities, but prioritize my work-life balance and my happiness.

                        I'm allowed to be selfish! I want to be in a position that earns well over 200k plus compensation. Be able to work remote with flexiblity and a balance when it comes to work and personal ventures/ adventures. I love Los Angeles, but an opportunity to build a career and be able to do it from anywhere seems like a dream.
