            <h2>By the end of the week...</h2>
            <p>
                I would like to continue developing my skills using HTML & CSS and practice any new exercises that I am challenged with. Also meet with my cohort and Derek at some point during the week.
            </p>
    
            <h2>By the end of the month...</h2>
            <p>
                I hope to say I've mastered a chapter of my web development journey. I want to create a consistent communication with Derek and observer a way of creating future projects and putting current goals into perspective. Want to make an effort to discuss and give my opinions on others works, not only to learn about the others but create more conversation. I want to have made at least 4 blog post.
            </p>
    
            <h2>By the end of the course...</h2>
            <p>
                I want to get an entry level job as a software engineer and or designer. I would love to make above 70k and be able to say I'm happy in my place of employment. The size of the company is still in question; I see benefits in all scenarios but I belive somewhere to get my feet wet and build a foundation may be best for the long run of my career.
            </p>
    
            <h2>5-year vision</h2>
            <p>
                I'm allowed to be selfish. I want to be in a position that earns 100k, remote flexiblity, with a great work-life balance. I love Los Angeles, but an opportunity to build a career and be able to do it from anywhere seems like a dream.
