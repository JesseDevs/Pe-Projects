<h2>Your favorite place.</h2>

<p>My favorite place would be the beach. I think the beach can be really calming and I've always been attracted to being inside of water and going for a swim. Just a place to have a good time and good vibes.</p>

<h2>Types of food.</h2>

<p>Hamburgers are an American classic. Pasta is the Italian classic. Both of these products can be full of experiments. Two buns that could contain any items inside it and call it a burger. Pasta with a sauce and you're good to go.</p>
