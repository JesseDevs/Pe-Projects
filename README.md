### Hey! My name is **Jesse** 🕵🏼


This project represents all the work I have started, completed, and continue to work on with [Perpetual Education](https://perpetual.education/). All subject matter revolves around coding but also takes into account design, user experience, and what it takes to go further. Perpetual Education is mentorship program I took part in to develop my skills and create a career opportunity that would utilize the best parts of *me*.

I've always had a passion to be creative, think beyond the normal, and problem solve but never felt that I was using those skills to the fullest of my abilities.

I obtained a Bachelor's Degree in Finance while working retail jobs to pay for school. During that period, I realized I was getting the most out of myself and wanted a change. Through my work experience I met individuals that introduced me to the idea of ***web development***.

When I'm not behind a screen you could find me playing the latest fighting game, making some music, or at the gym.
