CAPCOM coined the term for their mascot character Ryu and thus the term evolved to represent that form of character. A Shoto is a Fight Game Character Stereotype that is now used to define a character with special moves that mirror Ryuâ€™s Hadouken, Shoryuken, and Tatsumaki Senpuu Kyaku. In other words, a character that has a fireball, a flying anti-air, a physical attack that travels forward is often considered a shoto.',

It is also very common in more modern fighting games for characters to have Super Armor along with strong defensive tools.
