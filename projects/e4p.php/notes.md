### Paint Caluculator

    Need to establish a default for varibles.

    $length
    $width

    $area = $length * $width

    This will give us the area in square feet that needs to be cover.

    Based on the area we will determine how many gallons of paint is needed.
    
    1 gallon = 350 square feet.

    Display number of gallons needed.

    Make a program that checks if the form has been submitted. When submitted I want it to check if there were values put into the form and are positive values.

**Quick Google**

ciel(***number***) - Rounds up a to the next integer value.
