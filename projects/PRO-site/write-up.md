# Personal Website

## Home
* Landing page. Very appealing.

   * I did originally want some svg animates based on scroll but might be too advanced at the moment.
* Business card? Me + a short and sweet description. Invites to get more info
* Link to blog.

* I don’t love dark and light mode, but showing that would be cool so it’s an idea.
* Would be cool to have some “things” that could change color from the user.

### Site Menu
* Dots on tabs in site-menu to show what page is currently active.
* Should it have links to parts of pages or different pages for each thing?
   * Site-menu to the right
   * Name in the header when scrolled below the landing?
      * Home
      * About
      * Projects

* Maybe site bar when scrolling past the heading - rotate 90deg.
