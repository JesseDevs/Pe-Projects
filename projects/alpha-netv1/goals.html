                <p>
                The past week has been spent practice and honing some of my current skills based on the lessons. I'm not sure what the future of this week upholds but I'm looking forward to working with and developing my PHP skills.

                <p>
                I would like to say I mastered the next chapter in my web development journey. I have been meeting with Derek on occasion and hope to take advantage of his expereince and knowledge with any minor questions, no need to google everything. I want to make an effort to create more discussions within the group with an active back and forth.

                <p>
                I want to get an entry level job as a software engineer and or designer. I would love to make above 70k and be able to say I'm happy in my place of employment. The size of the company is still in question. I see benefits in all scenarios but I belive somewhere to get my feet wet and build a foundation may be best for the long run of my career. I'm open to all possibilities, but prioritize my work-life balance and my happiness. 
                </p>

                <h2 class="attention-voice">5-year vision</h2>
                <p>
                I'm allowed to be selfish! I want to be in a position that earns well over 100k plus compensation. Be able to work remote with flexiblity and a balance when it comes to work and personal ventures/ adventures. I love Los Angeles, but an opportunity to build a career and be able to do it from anywhere seems like a dream.
