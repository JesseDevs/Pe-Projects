                            Hey! My name is Jesse Felix. I was born and raised in Los Angeles, California. I come from a Hispanic background and cherish a lot of those experiences.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I've always had a passion to create a vision for others to see, but at times didn't know how I would get that opportunity and reach a point of "success". I obtained a bachelor's degree in business finance and while working with tech and helping others learn about using their tech; I realized I was heading in the wrong profession. I want to be creative. I want to problem-solve. I want to think critically. Those things make me feel like I carry my own worth. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I started to learn web development and joined a mentorship program under the guidance of <a href="perpetual.education">Perpetual Education.</a> I enjoy going to the gym, checking out some of the latest music or movies that is out, and you could catch me playing games online otherwise.
                        </p>
