# Theme Project

This project is a taken on [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/). We at Perpetual Education were given a layout to design and meet some standards in a set industry. My choice was sports news sites, specifically taking a large portion of inspiration from [Bleacher Report](https://bleacherreport.com/).

Each section can be split into its exisitng module:
- Header
- Landing
- Call to Action 
- Article Grid
- Footer
